<h1>About Me</h1>
<ul>
<li>Trying new things keeps me going — whether it's picking up a new tech skill, sketching late at night, or diving into a new topic out of pure curiosity.</li><br/>
<li>I'm currently pursuing Chemical Engineering at IIT (BHU), but my interests go well beyond the usual coursework. I'm actively exploring programming, web development, and slowly building my way into tech.</li><br/>
<li>Beyond the screen, I express myself through art — from pencil sketches to wall paintings, I enjoy turning imagination into something visual and meaningful.</li><br/>
<li>I love taking initiative, creating value, and constantly pushing myself to learn — whether it's a new skill, a better approach, or a different way of thinking.</li><br/>
<li>Still exploring. Still evolving. But every step forward is taken with purpose.</li><br/>
</ul>
