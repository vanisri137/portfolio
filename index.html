    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Trying new things keeps me going â€” whether it's picking up a new tech skill, sketching late at night, or diving into a new topic out of pure curiosity.<br />I'm currently pursuing Chemical Engineering at IIT (BHU), but my interests go well beyond the usual coursework. I'm actively exploring programming, web development, and slowly building my way into tech.<br />Beyond the screen, I express myself through art â€” from pencil sketches to wall paintings, I enjoy turning imagination into something visual and meaningful.<br />I love taking initiative, creating value, and constantly pushing myself to learn â€” whether it's a new skill, a better approach, or a different way of thinking.<br />Still exploring. Still evolving. But every step forward is taken with purpose.</p>

        <h4>Auto Cutoff Level Sensor for Water Tank</h4>
        Exploratory Project | Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT BHU <br/>
Supervisor: Dr. Ravi P. Jaiswal <br />

<ul>In an effort to address the growing water crisis and minimize wastage due to overflow in domestic tanks, our team developed a smart auto-cutoff system using a float switch-based sensor. This low-cost and reliable mechanism automatically regulates the water pump based on real-time water levels in the tankâ€”turning it ON when the level is low and OFF when the tank is full.<br />

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:<br/>
*Uses a float switch for water level detection.<br/>
*Automatically controls the pump, eliminating the need for manual intervention.<br/>
*Promotes water conservation, reduces electricity usage, and prevents water spillage.<br/>
*Can be adapted for both domestic and industrial water tanks.<br/>

This project not only enhances sustainability but also supports practical, hands-on learning in automation and sensor-based solutions.</ul>
